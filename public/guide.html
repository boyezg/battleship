            <h2>Battleship Game Guide</h2>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
            <p>Battleship is a two-player strategy game. Players take turns guessing the location of each other's ships on a 10x10 grid. The objective is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Place your fleet (Aircraft Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser, Submarine, Destroyer) on your grid.</li>
                <li>Take turns guessing coordinates (e.g., "B5").</li>
                <li>"Hit" or "Miss" will be announced based on the guess.</li>
                <li>Track progress to sink all ships.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Winning:</strong></p>
            <p>The first player to sink all ships wins!</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Spread your ships apart and watch patterns!</p>
